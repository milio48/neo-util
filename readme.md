# Blogger Data Provider Theme & DOM Parser

## What is this? ü§î

This project offers a unique approach to working with Blogger. It provides:

1.  A **minimalist Blogger XML theme** (`neo-util.xml`) that focuses *solely* on outputting your blog's data (posts, pages, labels, etc.) into a clean, predictable HTML structure. It's **not designed for visual appeal**.
2.  A companion **JavaScript parser** (`neo-parser.js`) that reads the HTML generated by the theme.

**The Goal:** To easily extract structured data from your Blogger blog so you can use it freely in your own custom JavaScript applications, frameworks (like React, Vue, Svelte), or other projects. Think of it as creating a simple data API layer for your Blogger site.

## Why use it? 

*   **Unlock Your Data:** Access posts, pages, labels, and blog info in a structured format (JavaScript object).
*   **Build Custom Frontends:** Use your favorite JS tools to create unique themes or web apps powered by your Blogger content.
*   **Separate Data & Presentation:** Keep your data source (Blogger + this theme) separate from how you display it (your JS code).
*   **Simple Integration:** Get started quickly without complex backend setups.

## How it Works (The Gist) ‚öôÔ∏è

1.  **Theme Renders:** You upload the special XML theme to your Blogger blog. When someone visits your blog, the theme outputs the relevant data using specific HTML structures (like tables for post lists and semantic tags for single posts/pages).
2.  **Parser Reads:** The theme automatically includes a `<script>` tag that loads the `neo-parser-dom.js` file (hosted on GitHub). This script runs in the visitor's browser after the page loads.
3.  **Data Object Created:** The parser analyzes the HTML structure (the DOM) generated by the theme and creates a convenient JavaScript object: `window.parsedBloggerDataDOM`. This object contains the extracted blog information and page-specific data.

## Usage

Getting started is straightforward:

1.  **Upload the Theme:**
    *   Go to your Blogger Dashboard -> Theme.
    *   Click "Edit HTML".
    *   Replace the *entire* content of the editor with the content of the `neo-data-provider.xml` file provided in this repository.
    *   Click "Save". (Ignore warnings about widget removal).

2.  **Access the Data in Your JavaScript:**
    *   The necessary parser (`neo-parser-dom.js`) is **already included** via a `<script>` tag within the `neo-data-provider.xml` theme file, pointing to its hosted location on GitHub. **You don't need to add it separately.**
    *   In your own JavaScript code (which you might add via Blogger's Layout gadgets, external files, or embed elsewhere), wait for the DOM to be ready, then access the global object `window.parsedBloggerDataDOM`.

**Example JavaScript:**

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  if (window.parsedBloggerDataDOM) {
    const blogData = window.parsedBloggerDataDOM;

    console.log("Successfully Parsed Blog Data!");
    console.log("Page Type:", blogData.pageType);
    console.log("Blog Info:", blogData.blog);
    console.log("Page Specific Data:", blogData.page);

    // Now you can use the 'blogData' object!
    // For example, if it's the homepage:
    if (blogData.pageType === 'homepage' && Array.isArray(blogData.page)) {
       // Loop through blogData.page (which is an array of posts)
       // and display them however you like.
    }

  } else {
    console.error("Could not find parsedBloggerDataDOM. Check theme setup and parser loading.");
  }
});
